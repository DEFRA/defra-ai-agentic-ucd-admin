# CONTEXT

We're developing a backend API that processes user research transcripts and then runs an agentic workflow to analyze the transcripts and produce and affinity map and research findings report.

The api will be a Python FastAPI server, with a mongo DB backend. We want to use MongoDB to maintain the research findings agentic state (LangGraph state) against an ID.

We also want to store a table of files associated with the research findings object, to be processed later by the LangGraph workflow.

When a user POSTs to the POST /api/v1/research-analysis endpoint, they will instantly get returned the new ID value from the mondgoDB for use in later async calls.

I'd like to create a data model based on the following project business and technical requirements.

ANALYSIS PHASE:

Look at the attached images of the FAST API endpoint design and langgraph state

Ask any follow up questions that will clear up any ambiguities if needed.

IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:

Think about the above requirements and work out a simplified data model suitable for use with [MongoDB]. Also produce a Mermaid diagram so it is understandable in a relational format. Feel free to change labels or column names to be more clear if needed if they are more logical. The data model should be in a single, downloadable file using markdown formatting.

Ensure the langgraph state is stored in a json object so it can be accessed and updated per LangGraph best practices

VERIFICATION AND COMPLETION PHASE:

- Make sure the final model covers all the requirements before returning a solution.

- Highlight any areas where you have made assumptions.
